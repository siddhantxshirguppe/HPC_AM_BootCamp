1. Laser Heat Transfer Simulation for Additive Manufacturing on Jupyter Notebook:
This project entails the development of a computational simulation model within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary objective is to simulate and analyze the heat transfer process that occurs during additive manufacturing.
The simulation involves mathematical and computational modeling to understand how laser interactions with materials influence heat distribution and ultimately impact the additive manufacturing process using Rosenthal's Solution.

2. Parallel Processing for Matrix Multiplication Operation using OpenMPI:
This project centers around the application of parallel processing techniques, specifically employing the OpenMPI framework. The core task is to optimize the computation of matrix multiplication by distributing the workload across multiple computing nodes.
Matrix multiplication is known for its computational intensity, and parallel processing serves to enhance efficiency and performance by orchestrating concurrent execution on multiple processors.

3. Sphere and Cube Visualization using Visualization Toolkit (VTK) Library:
In this project, the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) library is utilized to create a comprehensive 3D visualization. The primary objective is to construct a visual representation featuring both a 3D sphere and a 3D cube.
VTK, renowned for its capabilities in 3D rendering and visualization, is employed to design and render the objects, define their appearance attributes, incorporate lighting effects, and establish an interactive visualization environment.
